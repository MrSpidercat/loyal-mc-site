## Getting Started

#### Creating a Base
The first thing you want to do is make sure you get far away from spawn and away from all other players so you can create a base.
Once you've spawned make your way over to one of the beacons at the gate, this will randomly tp (RTP) you farther from spawn. Once you've been RTP'd collect some materials, kill some animals, and find a place to make your temporary base (you can run the /sethome command to set your home here). Once you've made your temporary base it's best to stay there until morning so you have as much time as possible to create your first base. Now that it's morning you need to travel farther away from spawn (I recommend traveling at least 1k blocks away from where you've been RTP'd). Look at your coordinates to make sure you're actually traveling away from spawn (Spawn is at 786, 69, -1009). Now that you've traveled even farther from spawn find a place to create your base (I recommend creating a somewhat hidden base to make sure nobody finds it). Now that you've found a place that you'd like to create your base, set your home there with the /sethome command.
