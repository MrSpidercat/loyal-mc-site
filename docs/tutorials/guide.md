## Getting Started 
The first thing you should do is get as far away from spawn as possible to create your base. Once you've joined, you can use a Wilderness TP beacon at one of the spawn gates to be teleported away from spawn. Once teleported, collect materials as you'd normally do to survive. It's best to start making your way as far from 0, 0 as possible because there are no claims meaning your land is unprotected. Now that you've found a place that you'd like to create your base, set your home there with the /sethome command (up to 10 homes can be set). If at any time you need to return to your home, type /home then the name of the home.
